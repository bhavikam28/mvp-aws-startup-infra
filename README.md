## Architecture Overview

This project implements an EC2-based Django application deployment backed by:

- Immutable AMIs built with **Packer**
- Infrastructure provisioning via **Terraform**
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with **OIDC authentication** to AWS
- Auto Scaling and Load Balancing via **ALB + ASG**
- Secrets managed via **SSM Parameter Store**
- Logging, metrics, and alarms with **CloudWatch**

---

## Key Features

- Django + PostgreSQL web application (Gunicorn + Nginx)
- Immutable AMI builds with **HashiCorp Packer**
- Infrastructure as Code using **Terraform**
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with **GitHub Actions**
- Secure, scalable deployments with **ASG** and **ALB**
- Centralized logging and custom metrics using **CloudWatch Agent**
- Secrets management via **SSM Parameter Store**
- Database hosted on **Amazon RDS**, migrated using **AWS DMS**
- Load testing using **Locust**

## Setup & Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhavikam28/mvp-aws-startup-infra.git
cd mvp-aws-startup-infra
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```
üîê **Update environment variables, secrets, and `settings.py` as required.**

---

## CI/CD Workflow

### 1. Build AMI with Packer
- Triggered on new GitHub release
- Installs Django app, dependencies, Nginx, Gunicorn, CloudWatch Agent

### 2. Provision Infrastructure with Terraform
- Deploys EC2 with Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- Sets up Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Creates IAM roles, security groups, and VPC networking components

### 3. Secrets & Configuration
- Uses **SSM Parameter Store** for secure secrets management
- Injects app configuration into EC2 instances via **User Data**

---

## Infrastructure Breakdown

### EC2 + ASG + ALB
- Custom AMIs launched into **Auto Scaling Group**
- **ALB** routes external traffic to instances
- Zero-downtime deployment using rolling updates

### PostgreSQL (RDS)
- AWS-managed PostgreSQL instance
- Migrated using **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**

### Storage
- Uploaded media/images stored in **Amazon S3**
- Delivered globally via **CloudFront CDN**

### Security
- IAM roles with **least-privilege access**
- EC2 access through **SSM Session Manager** (no SSH needed)

---

## Monitoring & Observability

- **CloudWatch Dashboards** for EC2, ALB, and RDS
- **CloudWatch Agent** collects memory, CPU, and disk metrics
- Log-based metric filters (e.g., image upload events)
- **SNS Alerts** for high CPU/memory or app failures
- Full observability provisioned via **Terraform**
